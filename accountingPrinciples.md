# Accounting Principles

## Introduction to Accounting Basics
* Transactions
* Income Statement - Show the profitability during the time interval
  * Revenue - the amount that was earned
    * acrrual basis of accounting: revenues are recorded when they are earned (revenue recognition principle)
  * Expense - the expenses necessary to earn the revenue
    * matching principle - the cost will be incurred in the associated period, if not period associated, it will be incurred immediately.
  * Net Income or Net Loss is presented 
* Balance Sheet - Asset - A company's financial position at a given moment
  * Assets - Include Accounts Receivables, Prepaid Expenses
    * Cost Principle: The accounting guideline requiring amounts in the accounts and on the financial statements to be the actual cost rather than the current value. Accountants can show an amount less than cost due to conservatism.
    * Depreciation  
  * Liability - Payables, Uneared/deferred revenue
  * Stockholders' (or owner's) equity - the difference between the asset amounts and the liability amounts
* Statement of Cash Flows
* Double entry
* Basic accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders' Equity
  * Debit the left, credit the right.
 Â * When the company receives cash -> debit the cash account
  * Revenues accounts are credited when the company earnes a fee, regardless of whether cash is received at the time.
  * **Expenses are (almost) always debited.**

## Debits and Credits
 * Accounts increase with a **Debit** Dividends Expenses Assets Losses
 * Accounts increase with a **Credit** Gains Income Revenus Liabilities Stockholders' equity
 
## Bookkeeping
 * **Accrued**: Not yet happened
 * **Deferred**: Already happened, but deferred to next accounting period.

## Accounting Equation
 * Assets = Liabilities + Owners'/Stockholders' Equity
 * Net income affects owner's equity
 * Expanded Accounting Equation for a Sole Proprietorship:
    * Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Capital + Revenues - Expenses - Owner's Draws
 * Expanded Accounting Equation for a Corporation:
    * Assets = Liabilities + Paid-in Capital + Revenues - Expenses - Dividend - Treasury Stock

## Adjusting Entries
 * Two scenarios where adjusting journal entries are needed:
 	* 1: Nothing has been entered in the accounting records for certain expenses or revenues, but those expenses and/or revenues did occur and must be included in the current period's income statement and balance sheet.
	* 2: Something has already been entered in the accounting records, but the amount needs to be divided up between two or more accounting periods.
	
 * Adjusting entries involve:
	* Balance sheet account (Interest Payable, Prepaid Insurance, Accounts Receivable, etc.)
	* Income statement account (Interest Expense, Insurance Expense, Service Revenues etc.)
	* Related accounts: Allowance for doubtful accounts, accumulated depreciation - equipment, unearned revenue

 * Accurals and Deferrals
  	* Accurals: for scenario 1.
	* Deferrals: for scenario 2.
	* Examples: 
		* Prepaid insurance after adjusting: The unexpired portion of the insurance premiums paid.
		* Deferred Revenues or Unearned Fees: The fees received in advance which are not yet earned.
